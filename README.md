# Explore US Bikeshare Data
This README is taken from Udacity's FWD Data Analysis Professional track.

# Bike Share Data
In this project, data was provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

# Dataset
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

1. Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
2. End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
3. Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
4. Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
5. End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
6. User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

1. Gender
2. Birth Year

# Statistics Computed
User can learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, the code provides the following information:

## Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

1. most common month
2. most common day of week
3. most common hour of day


## Popular stations and trip

1. most common start station
2. most common end station
3. most common trip from start to end 

## Trip duration

1. total travel time
2. average travel time


## User info

1. counts of each user type
2. counts of each gender 
3. earliest, most recent, most common year of birth
